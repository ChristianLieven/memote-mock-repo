Unlike the analogous demand (SBO:....)\n    reactions, which are usually designated as irreversible, sink reactions\n    always represent a reversible uptake/secretion processes, and act as a\n    metabolite source with no cost to the cell. Sink reactions, also referred\n    to as R_SINK_, are generally used for compounds that are metabolized by\n    the cell but are produced by non-metabolic, un-modeled cellular processes.'\n    Every sink reaction should be annotated with\n    this. Sink reactions differ from exchange reactions in that the metabolites\n    are not removed from the extracellular environment, but from any of the\n    organism's compartments.",
